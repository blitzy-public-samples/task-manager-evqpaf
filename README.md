# Task Management System

A comprehensive task management solution designed to streamline project organization, team collaboration, and task tracking.

## Overview

The Task Management System is a modern, cloud-native application built with scalability, security, and user experience in mind. It provides robust features for managing tasks, projects, and team collaboration through a microservices architecture.

### Key Features

- Task Creation and Management
- Project Organization
- Team Collaboration
- Real-time Notifications
- Role-based Access Control
- API-first Design
- Responsive Web Interface

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.x or higher
- Docker and Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL 14 or higher
- Redis 7.0 or higher

### Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/organization/task-management-system.git
cd task-management-system
```

2. Create environment files:
```bash
cp src/backend/.env.example src/backend/.env
cp src/web/.env.example src/web/.env
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
# Backend services
cd src/backend
npm install

# Frontend application
cd ../web
npm install
```

4. Start the development environment:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

This will start the following services:
- API Gateway (port 3000)
- Notification Service (port 3001)
- Project Service (port 3002)
- Task Service (port 3003)
- User Service (port 3004)
- Web Application (port 8080)
- PostgreSQL Database (port 5432)
- Redis Cache (port 6379)

## Architecture

The system follows a microservices architecture with the following key components:

- **API Gateway**: Entry point for all client requests
- **Core Services**: 
  - User Service: User management and authentication
  - Task Service: Task creation and lifecycle management
  - Project Service: Project organization and team management
  - Notification Service: Real-time notifications and alerts
- **Data Layer**: 
  - PostgreSQL for persistent storage
  - Redis for caching and real-time features
- **Infrastructure**: AWS-based cloud infrastructure managed through Terraform

For detailed architecture information, see [Architecture Documentation](docs/architecture.md).

## API Documentation

The system provides a comprehensive RESTful API. Each service exposes its own set of endpoints:

- Authentication: `/api/auth/*`
- Users: `/api/users/*`
- Tasks: `/api/tasks/*`
- Projects: `/api/projects/*`
- Notifications: `/api/notifications/*`

For detailed API documentation, see the OpenAPI specification in the `api-docs` directory.

## Security

Security is a top priority in the Task Management System. Key security features include:

- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Secure session management
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Regular security audits

For detailed security information, see [Security Documentation](docs/security.md).

## Deployment

The system can be deployed using Docker and Kubernetes. Deployment configurations are provided for different environments:

- Development: `docker-compose.dev.yml`
- Staging: `kubernetes/staging/*`
- Production: `kubernetes/production/*`

For detailed deployment instructions, see [Deployment Documentation](docs/deployment.md).
