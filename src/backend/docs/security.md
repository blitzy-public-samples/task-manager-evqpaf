## Introduction

This document outlines the security architecture, protocols, and compliance measures implemented in the Task Management System. It provides comprehensive guidance on security measures, including authentication mechanisms, data protection strategies, monitoring systems, and compliance frameworks.

## Authentication and Authorization

<!-- Requirement: Authentication and Authorization (Technical Specification/2.5 Security Architecture) -->

### JWT-Based Authentication
- Implementation of secure JWT (JSON Web Token) validation
- Token structure includes user ID, email, role, and expiration time
- Tokens are signed using a secure secret key
- Token expiration and rotation policies are enforced

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Hierarchical role system with predefined permissions
- Role validation on every protected endpoint
- Granular access control at resource level
- Supported roles:
  - Admin: Full system access
  - Manager: Team and project management capabilities
  - User: Basic task management functions

### Security Headers
```typescript
{
    'X-Frame-Options': 'DENY',
    'X-Content-Type-Options': 'nosniff',
    'X-XSS-Protection': '1; mode=block',
    'Strict-Transport-Security': 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains'
}
```

## Data Security

<!-- Requirement: Data Security (Technical Specification/6.2 Data Security) -->

### Encryption
- Data-at-rest encryption using AES-256
- TLS 1.3 for data-in-transit encryption
- Secure key management through AWS KMS
- Password hashing using bcrypt with appropriate salt rounds

### Database Security
- Connection pooling with encrypted connections
- Prepared statements to prevent SQL injection
- Regular security patches and updates
- Automated backup system with encryption

### Access Control
- Principle of least privilege enforcement
- Network segmentation using VPC
- Security groups for granular access control
- Regular access reviews and audits

## Security Monitoring

<!-- Requirement: Security Monitoring (Technical Specification/6.3 Security Protocols) -->

### Logging and Monitoring
- Centralized logging system using Winston
- Real-time security event monitoring
- Automated alerts for suspicious activities
- Log retention policy compliance

### Security Events Monitored
1. Authentication attempts
   - Success/failure tracking
   - Brute force detection
   - Unusual login patterns

2. Authorization violations
   - Unauthorized access attempts
   - Permission escalation attempts
   - Resource access violations

3. System anomalies
   - Unusual traffic patterns
   - Resource utilization spikes
   - API rate limit violations

### Monitoring Implementation
```typescript
// Example logging configuration
{
    level: 'info',
    format: winston.format.json(),
    defaultMeta: { service: 'task-management' },
    transports: [
        new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'error.log', level: 'error' }),
        new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'combined.log' })
    ]
}
```

## Compliance Requirements

    - Real-time monitoring
    - Alert mechanisms

## Incident Response Plan

### Incident Classification
1. High Severity
   - Data breaches
   - System compromise
