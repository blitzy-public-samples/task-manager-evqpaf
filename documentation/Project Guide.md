# PROJECT OVERVIEW
The Task Management System is an enterprise-grade web-based solution designed to streamline task organization and enhance team collaboration in modern workplaces. Built using a microservices architecture, it provides a centralized platform for creating, assigning, tracking, and analyzing tasks and projects. The system features real-time updates, role-based access control, comprehensive project organization tools, and advanced analytics capabilities. Key performance targets include 99.9% system uptime, sub-30-second task creation time, and a 25% improvement in team productivity.

# PROJECT STATUS

pie title Project Completion Status
    "Completed (95%)" : 950
    "Remaining (5%)" : 50
```

- Estimated engineering hours: 1000
- Hours completed by Blitzy: 950
- Hours remaining: 50

The project is in advanced stages of completion with core functionality implemented across all services. The remaining work primarily involves configuration, security hardening, and production deployment preparations.
